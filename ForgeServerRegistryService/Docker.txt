Instructions for creating a docker container

Preperations:

You will need:
-  .NET SDK version 6.0 or later. Download .NET SDK.
-  Docker running locally. 
-  Visual Studio or other IDE

Follow this guide: https://docs.docker.com/language/dotnet/build-images/


Build:

1. Remove the Forge Project references
2. Rebuild the Forge project
3. copy the Forge.dll into ForgeServerREgistryService/Refs
4. Add reference to the copied Forge.dll
5. Open a command prompt at: /ForgeAlloy
6. Run: docker build --tag forgeserverregistryservice .

Once you are done, remove the reference to Forge.dll and restore reference to the Forge project.
Change the project references is a hack, because I couldn't work out how to configure the
Dockerfile to include the Forge project.

Execute:

To execute, run with the -p option to port forward the appropriate port.
Use the UDP suffix if appropriate

docker run -p 15940:15940/udp -d forgeserverregistryservice
